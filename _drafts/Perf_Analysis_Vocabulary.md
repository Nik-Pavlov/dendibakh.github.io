For a begginer it can be a very hard time looking in a profile generated by the tool like perf or Intel Vtune Amplifier. It immediately throws at you lots of strange terms, which you might not know. Whenever I'm presenting to the audience or speaking with somebody who is not very much involved into performance analysis activities, they ask the same basic questions. Like: "What is instruction retired?" or "What is reference cycles?". So, I decided to write an article describing some of unobvious terms connected with performance analysis.

### Instruction retired
 
### UOP 
issued executed retired 

### Reference cycle 

### Clock_unhalted 



### CPI & IPC 

Insert formula (from videoportal)

### Instruction latency and throughput

Take description from Agner Fog.
Draw a table with pipeline diagramm.

### mispredicted branch 

### Uncore (offcore)
