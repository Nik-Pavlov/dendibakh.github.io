The processor recognizes that certain instructions are
independent of the prior value of the register if the two operand registers are the same

This register is set to zero at the rename stage by these instructions. The throughput is four
of these zeroing instructions per clock cycle, because no execution unit is used

An eliminated move has zero latency and does not use any execution port. But is does
consume bandwidth in the decoders

Zero latency instructions (for example NOP instructions) don't consume scheduler
resources.  However, those instructions still reserve a number of slots in the
reorder buffer.

Move elimination is not always successful. It fails when the necessary operands are not
ready. But typically, move elimination succeeds in more than 80% of the possible cases.
Chained moves can also be eliminated
Move elimination is possible with all 32-bit and 64-bit general purpose registers and all 128-
bit and 256-bit vector registers.

Experiments:

NOP

mov eax, 0
xor eax, eax

; Example 9.3. Move elimintaion
add eax,4
mov ebx,eax ; this move can be eliminated128
sub ebx,ecx


mov eax, 1 ; will be eliminated?
mov eax, 2 

xor eax, eax 
sub ebx, eax ; will be eliminated? (eax is 0)
vs
xor eax, eax 
sub ebx, 0 ; will be eliminated?
