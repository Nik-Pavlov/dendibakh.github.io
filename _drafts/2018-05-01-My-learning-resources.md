About a year ago I joined C/C++ compiler team at Intel. And some people asked me how to become a compiler developer, because I assume that for many C++ developers compiler is just a piece of magic. Now, I don't consider myself an expert in this field, but still I decided to share with others what learning resources do I use. And it's not limited to compilers, but in general. I hope that someone will find something useful in this post.

### Online courses

### Podcasts

[CppCast](http://cppcast.com/) - podcast for C++ developers by C++ developers. I'm their regrular listener from the very first episodes. Although I'm not that focused on modern features of C++ than I used to be in the past, but I still listen this podcast during my way to the office each Friday morning. Even though I'm now not spending my time on playing with C++17 and such, but it's really good source of information of keeping up-to-date with the new stuff that's coming in C++ world. I still consider myself as a part of this community. Rob and Jason are doing really great work!

[Simple Programmer podcast](https://simpleprogrammer.com/podcasts/) - podcast mostly about soft skills. I was so upset when John Sonmez said he will stop doing this podcast. This was a trully gem for me, I really learned a lot from his podcasts. He usually speaks about simple things. and which not so easy to do.

After his course on [making your own blog](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) I restarted my blog, because he really showed me the value of doing it.
