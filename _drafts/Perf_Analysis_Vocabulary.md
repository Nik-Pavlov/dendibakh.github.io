For a begginer it can be a very hard time looking in a profile generated by the tool like perf or Intel Vtune Amplifier. It immediately throws at you lots of strange terms, which you might not know. Whenever I'm presenting to the audience or speaking with somebody who is not very much involved into performance analysis activities, they ask the same basic questions. Like: "What is instruction retired?" or "What is reference cycles?". So, I decided to write an article describing some of unobvious terms connected with performance analysis.

### Instruction retired

### UOP 
issued executed retired 
Uop or μop is an abbreviation for micro-operation. Processors with out-of-order cores are capable of splitting complex instructions into μops. For example, a read-modify instruction may be split into a read-μop and a modify-μop. The number of μops that an instruction generates is important when certain bottlenecks in the pipeline limit the number of μops per clock cycle.

### Reference cycle 

### Clock_unhalted 



### CPI & IPC 

Insert formula (from videoportal)

### Instruction latency and throughput

Take description from Agner Fog.
Draw a table with pipeline diagramm.

### Mispredicted branch 

### Uncore (offcore)
