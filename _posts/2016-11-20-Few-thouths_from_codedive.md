It's my second time I've beed on Code::Dive conference in Wroclaw.
This year it was on 15-16 November. We had a really great speakers such as Chandler Carruth, Sean Parent and Mark Issacson.

It was amazing opportunity to hear talks on compiler optimizations, clang tools, undefined behaviour, C++ history and future and best practices.
All talks should be available on youtube shortly.

Really many-many thanks to Nokia for such a great free conference!
Looking forward to attend next year (probably as a speaker).

Things I learned from this conference:
